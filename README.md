# Description
This project implements the classic Pong game where one player competes against an AI opponent. The player controls a paddle using the keyboard, while the AI paddle tracks the ball's y-position to simulate an opponent. The game includes scoring, collision detection, and a simple game loop, making it an excellent starting point for learning Pygame and basic AI principles.
Features

Player vs. AI Gameplay: Control the right paddle to hit the ball against an AI-controlled left paddle.
Simple AI: The opponent paddle uses a rule-based algorithm to follow the ball.
Score Tracking: Displays scores for both player and AI at the top of the screen.
Smooth Gameplay: Runs at 60 FPS with collision detection and responsive controls.

# Installation

Prerequisites:
Python 3.9
Pygame library


Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/2002Bhargavi/pong_with_ai.git
cd pong-with-ai


Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Pygame:pip install pygame



How to Run

Ensure Pygame is installed (see Installation).
Run the game:python pong_with_ai.py


The game window will open, and you can start playing immediately.

Gameplay

Controls:
Up Arrow: Move the right paddle up.
Down Arrow: Move the right paddle down.


Objective: Hit the ball past the AI opponent’s paddle to score points. The AI scores if the ball passes your paddle.
Scoring: Scores are displayed at the top (AI on the left, player on the right).
Exit: Close the window or press Ctrl+C in the terminal to quit.
